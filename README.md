## TL;DR

We introduce **`JavisGPT`**, a multimodal LLM that can understand audiovisual inputs and simultaneously generate synchronized sounding videos in a unified model. 
We also curate the **`JavisInst-Omni`** dataset to facilitate instruction-tuning for comprehension and generation on sounding videos.
